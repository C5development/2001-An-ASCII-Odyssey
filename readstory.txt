It is the year 413987, the human race has reached such level of technological progress it has been entirely transformed into a new species
able to genetically modify any form of carbon-based life that can be found in the universe. It is now an atemporal species whose main 
purpose is to expand across the deep dark confines of the universe. The perception of time does not exist for this new augmented cyborg
race travelling errant through space and time in search of organic planets where colonies can be created and humans raised in genetical
farms to be turned into smart crazy scientists, robo-slaves or incontrollable and relentless cyborg soldiers ready to destroy everything 
they find in their way in the most unimaginably cruel of ways...
But there are other civilisations spreading their seed accross this vast, amoral, merciless yet beautiful space in hope of 
surviving and finding out what lies behind the enthropy of an intergalactic vaccuum. Bewildering flashes of colourful light are emitted 
from distant galaxies pouring through the eyes of a mystical, strange and hopeless advanced civilisation. There are creatures awaiting
behind the shadows of the hyper massive black-holes that are ripping off the corners of the universe. 
An evil AI-ruled empire wants to exert its power over all innocent creatures that can be found in the most distant galaxies 
and only you can use  the energy of the universe to undermine its evil plans. Other civilisations will have to be sacrificed for a greater
purpose, you are the only one who has power over life and death, use that power wisely since the eternal enthropy of the universe
will have no mercy upon you nor the miserable souls with which you embarked on this adventure.
Good luck, Captain.
